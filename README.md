# School_exercise_site

This is the last part of an exercise for my school in the class Technologies and Programming of Applications in the Web
("Τεχνολογίες και Προγραμματισμός Εφαρμογών στον Ιστό").

In the index.html page the is a link for a main page ("Back to main page index_exercise1"). This link will not go to the page 
index_exercise1 because it's a previous part of the exercise which i didn't upload.

The purpose of this exercise is to learn to use HTML ,CSS ,Javascript in order to create an interesting site.


A variety of things have been used as the change of an image with a button or a hover with a pink color which aren't always pleasing
for a site, but these were asked in the exercise to show our undertanding to the class.
